// Doom64-RT: LOCALISED SMOKE in the froxel volume.
//
// The volumetric medium (Volumetric.h, RtVolumetric.rgen) is ONE density for
// the whole level and the grid is camera-fitted, so there is no way to say
// "there is smoke HERE". This adds a small list of world-space spheres whose
// density is ADDED to that medium, evaluated per froxel.
//
// Everything downstream is untouched. CmVolumetricProcess.comp is a straight
// front-to-back prefix sum over whatever the raygen wrote, so a puff gets
// correct occlusion and transmittance for free -- it darkens what is behind it
// and is darkened by fog in front of it, with no second pass and no extra rays.
//
// THE PROPERTY THIS FILE HAS TO KEEP: with smokeCount 0 every function here
// returns zero, and the caller's arithmetic collapses back to exactly the fog's
// two lines. The fog is shipped and tuned against a measured transmittance
// ladder (docs/rt-fog.md); smoke may not move it. See the collapse note at
// smoke_blendTint below.
//
// The puffs ride in the global uniform rather than a storage buffer: at
// SMOKE_PUFF_MAX 128 that is 6 KB in a UBO that already carries
// viewProjCubemap, against a whole descriptor set and a per-frame staging copy
// for a LightManager-shaped buffer. 128 takes the whole ShGlobalUniform to 8160
// bytes, still under the 16384 the Vulkan spec guarantees for
// maxUniformBufferRange -- which is the ceiling on this approach. If the budget
// ever needs hundreds, THAT is when the storage buffer earns its complexity.
//
// The cap and the BUDGET are different numbers and are limited by different
// things. The cap is uniform bytes. The budget -- how many are uploaded -- is
// shader time, because smoke_evalAt below runs per froxel; that is what the
// early reject in it exists to flatten.
